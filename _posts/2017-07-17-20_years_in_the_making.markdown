I don't remember exactly when I wrote my first line of code.  It had to be around 1998.   At that time, GeoCities was the place to be if you wanted to create your own website.  So I started playing around, taught myself some HTML, and built some basic sites.  I still remember the struggles of building websites using tables for images and iFrames for sidebars.  And I loved every minute of it.

Needless to say, I was a bit of a nerd.  I did well in school, was fascinated by computers, and thought the internet was the cooler than the other side of the pillow.  But when it came to deciding what I wanted to study, and what I wanted to do with my life, for some reason code never entered my mind.  At some point (gasp), I had decided I wanted to be a lawyer.  

When I got to college, set on going to law school, most of the classes I took were in the social sciences.  I majored in government, and minored in history.  I did take one computer science class, though, and completely loved it.  While others in my Intro to CS class struggled, the basics came pretty easily to me, no doubt thanks to my teenage exploits.  Looking back, I really wish I knew then what I know now.  You know what they say about hindsight.

Anyway, I decided at the end of college that law school wasn't for me.  The idea of being a lawyer just didn't excite me, and neither did the notion of three more years of school and god knows how much more in student loans.  The problem was, I had no idea *what* excited me.  So I took the first job I could find, and ended up writing proposals for a government contractor for a year.  I was completely miserable.  I still didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, but at least I had successfully crossed one thing off my list.

After about a year, I took a job in customer support at a survey software company.  I had gotten really interested in tech startups, and decided that one day I would start my own.  And what better way to learn about startups than to work for one?  

I enjoyed teaching others how to use the software, testing it to find bugs, and working with the engineers to make sure things worked the way they were supposed to, and that our users were happy.  I loved interacting with customers, submitting ideas for new features to our product team, and seeing those features built and eventually used by real people.  I did very well, and grew into various roles in the company, from project management to account management, and finally to sales.  Wherever the company needed someone, that's where I went, and I learned a ton along the way.

The opportunity to work at a software company confirmed for me that this is the world I want to be in, and that I want to be able to write the code, or at least understand the code, behind the products being built.  So now, 20 years after my first experience with coding, I'm diving in head first.  And I'm excited about what the future holds!
