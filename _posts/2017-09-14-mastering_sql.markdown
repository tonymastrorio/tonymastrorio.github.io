After being out of commission the past week due to Hurricane Irma, it's great to be back coding again!

When I began the Flatiron School curriculum, I had some basic knowledge of SQL and how it worked.

I've created basic apps using PHP and MySQL in the past that required the ability to insert, select and delete data from a database using SQL, but I knew there was a lot more to it, and am excited by how much I've learned recently.

Learning complex joins was challenging, but being able to join tables together and group and sort data from those tables is a great skill to have.  And while I know there are times that knowledge will come in very useful, it's also great to know that ActiveRecord abstracts a lot of repetetive SQL queries away for us.

In the next few weeks, I expect to have completed the Sinatra section and will have built my first app using the Sinatra framework.  Exciting times!
