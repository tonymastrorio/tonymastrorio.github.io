I've been coding in rails for about the past month, and I have to say I'm loving it!  Now I understand why ruby on rails is referred to as a language built for developer happiness.  From being able to generate the entire structure of an application with a single command in the console, to all the different gems available that can save you countless hours of research and coding, to the helper methods that eliminate the need for writing lots of tedious HTML, rails really does seem like magic.

I'm finishing up coding my first real app in rails, and it's been a blast.  The app is aimed at web developers and designers and allows them to easily create and maintain a minimalistic portfolio of their work without having to worry about building and hosting a website of their own.  It currently allows anyone to filter through portfolios based on languages or skills used, although I plan to update the app to allow for other filtering options as well.

The best part is that what took me only a few days in rails would have taken several weeks without the framework.  As an example, using the Omniauth and Devise gems alone saved me a ton of time by taking care of the heavy lifting of user authentication, and providing me with a more secure and flexible app in the process.  I also found a wonderful gem called paperclip that allows for easy file attachment in a rails application so my users can upload photos to their portfolios.  Throughout the process, any time I had a question or encountered a new feature or gem I wanted to use, I had no trouble finding decent documentation or examples on Stack Overflow to serve as my guide.

Now having built apps in both Sinatra and Rails, I'm feeling much more comfortable with designing an app from the perspective of figuring out the necessary models and relationships between model classes, as well as following the MVC architecture pattern.

I'm looking forward to turning some of my attention towards javascript and the react framework and polishing up my front end skills.
